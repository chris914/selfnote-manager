# Self note manager
Simple WPF based application to effectively manage notes.

***
### What is this?
During my thesis project I had to save a lot of links and articles. I found it hard to do it in the regular way, so I created this little self note application.

***
### How it works?
It's very easy!
- Select any text you want to save for later and press the caps lock key twice. 
- This will bring up the note saaving window where you can add title, tags, or make it a note category.
- If you want to add the text to a note category hold the second press of the caps key and select the category with your mouse. The selected text gets appended to the category.
